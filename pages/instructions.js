      <h1 className={styles.headingOne}>What is Instrumentation Generation?</h1>
      <div className={styles.container}>
        <p>
          Instrumentation Generation is a tool for composersâ€”the first tool in a
          planned compositional toolkit. Instrumentation Generation allows you
          to generate random groups of instruments, with varying parameters and
          templates to mix things up. Instrumentation Generation will generate
          you a list, and then you, the composer, are challenged to create some
          new piece of music, just using the given random instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not a composer? That's okay too! The tool is still fun to play with,
          and when that get's old, you can make your way to the Instrument
          Library and learn about new instruments through their descriptions,
          youtube links and wikipedia references.
        </p>
        <p>
          The generator contains over 200 instruments and over 25 templates to
          start with!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to support the project, please check out the
          "support" section, and consider donating or purchasing the instrument
          icons for commercial and personal use! And if you come across an error
          of any kind, please let me know via the 'Feedback' page!

        Where am i supposed to get all these instruments?

          If you're sitting here worried about the fact that you might not have
          your clavicord nor crumhorn nor your sitar nor sheng still laying
          around, then let me tell you not to worry!
        </p>
        <p>
          When recording, or atleast sketching, with these instruments, you are
          more likely than not going to be using a virtual instrument (.vst,
          .vst3) within a digital audio workstation (DAW). There are a number of
          free and cheap ones (some that contain lots of instruments) that i
          will reccomend to you to get started!

        <p>
          <strong>Start with a template:</strong> Clicking on the 'Templates'
          button, brings up a window that will allow you to peruse a couple
          dozen templates that you can start with and modify the instrumentation
          of.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Generate a new list of instruments: </strong> Generating a new
          list will replace your current instrumentation with an entirely new
          list. It asks for a range, but if you want a specific size, you can
          just put the same number in both fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Add a random group of new instruments: </strong>Adding a new
          group of instruments will generate as many random instruments as you
          ask for and add them to your list!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Choose an instrument to add to the list: </strong> Choose one
          specific instrument to add to your instrumentation list.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>No Duplicates: </strong>If you dont want multiple of each
          instrumnet to be able to be generated, check 'No Duplicates' and it
          will make sure every instrument that is generated for your list is not
          a duplicate. This does not retroactively apply to instruments already
          in your list.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Clear List: </strong>Clicking 'Clear List' will remove all
          instruments from your list, starting you over fresh
        </p>
        <h5 style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>Instrument Cards</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Lock: </strong>Locking your instrument prevents it from being
          deleted in all fashions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Shuffle: </strong>The shuffle button will replace just that
          instrument with a random instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Delete: </strong>The delete button removes your instruments
          from the list.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Replace: </strong>The replace button allows you to pick an
          instrument to replace it with.
